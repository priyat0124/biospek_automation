Consultancy Project – BioSpek

I worked on a consultancy project for BioSpek, where I developed a web application using JavaScript to support their business requirements. The application was designed with a user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth navigation and efficient interaction.

This project helped me gain practical experience in web application development, client requirement analysis, and real-time problem solving, while delivering a solution aligned with the company’s needs.
